        <h2>Built for local communities first</h2>
        <p>
          BinZ simplifies scrap collection for residential areas, college campuses and local communities.
          The model removes middlemen, supports local collectors, brings fair pricing into view and adds
          reward-based incentives for responsible recycling.
        </p>
        <p>
          The long-term vision includes AI-driven waste sorting and recycling tracking, so every pickup
          can become cleaner, more accountable and easier to scale.
